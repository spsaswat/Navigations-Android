# Sample App for Android Navigation Architecture Component

This sample application written in pure Kotlin explains how to use the new Android Navigation architecture component which is part of the Android Jetpack in order to easily create navigation graphs similar to Storyboards in iOS

[Medium article I wrote with steps to create simple navigation project](https://medium.com/@prasannajeet/using-the-navigation-architecture-component-in-android-jetpack-kotlin-48d4167ec9e5)

_**Since Navigation architecture component is in alpha, this repository will be constantly updated to consume the latest builds**_

This sample app has used 3 navigation pathways
1. From fragment to activity
2. From one fragment to another
3. 2 Step navigation involving 3 fragments

Following image shows how the navigation graph is this project.
